Analytics Portfolio

## *Project_1: [Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) for Data Science and Machine Learning](https://github.com/Sai-Vikhyath/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/EDA%20for%20Data%20Science%20and%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb)*
- Comprehensive EDA Approach: Performed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on regression and classification datasets (diabetes and iris), including data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.
- Data Preprocessing Expertise: Applied techniques like  one-hot encoding, missing data imputation, and train-test splitting  to optimize model performance.
- Visualization & Statistical Analysis: Utilized histograms, boxplots, correlation matrices, and pair plots  to extract valuable insights and enhance data understanding.
- Model Improvement through EDA: Leveraged EDA findings to improve predictive accuracy and optimize regression and classification models *.
- Key Libraries & Tools: Worked with pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, MissingNo, and scikit-learn to perform efficient data analysis and modeling.
