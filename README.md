Analytics Portfolio

## *Project_1: [Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) for Data Science and Machine Learning](https://github.com/Sai-Vikhyath/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/EDA%20for%20Data%20Science%20and%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb)*
- **Comprehensive EDA Approach**: Performed detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on regression and classification** datasets (diabetes and iris), including data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.
- **Data Preprocessing Expertise**: Applied techniques like  **one-hot encoding, missing data imputation, and train-test** splitting  to optimize model performance.
- **Visualization & Statistical Analysis**: Utilized **histograms, boxplots, correlation matrices, and pair plots**  to extract valuable insights and enhance data understanding.
- **Model Improvement through EDA**: Leveraged EDA findings to improve predictive accuracy and optimize **regression and classification** models.
- **Key Libraries & Tools**: Worked with **pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, MissingNo, and scikit-learn** to perform efficient data analysis and modeling.

## *Project_2: [Exploratory Data Analysis of Banking Client Data Using Pandas](https://github.com/Sai-Vikhyath/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20of%20Banking%20Client%20Data.ipynb)*
- **Data Exploration**: Analyzed a bank marketing dataset to understand customer responses and behaviors using Pandas.
- **Customer Insights**: Calculated key metrics like average call duration, customer age, and response rates to telemarketing campaigns.
- **Pivot Tables**: Built pivot tables to explore relationships between *customer features, such as age, marital status, and job type*.
- **Visualization**: Utilized **scatter plots, box plots, and pair plots** to visualize feature dependencies and distribution patterns.
- **Marketing Strategy Optimization**: Provided data-driven insights to help plan more targeted and effective marketing campaigns for banking services.

  ## *Project_3: [Global Covid-19 Analysis: Deaths, Cases and Vaccination Trends Using Power BI and ](https://github.com/Sai-Vikhyath/Global-Covid-19-Analysis/tree/main)[Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sai.vikhyath.katti/viz/Covid-19Dashboard_17398757291710/Dashboard1)*
- **Covid-19 Data Analysis**: Worked on comprehensive analysis of global Covid-19 data, including total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Developed advanced queries to calculate death percentages, Covid infection rates relative to population, and vaccination rates.
- **Data Integration**: Merged multiple datasets (CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations) to assess the correlation between vaccination efforts and infection/death rates.
- **Visualization Preparation**: Created views and temporary tables to facilitate easy extraction and visualization of key metrics, including rolling vaccination numbers and death rates by region and country.
- **Database Optimization**: Utilized advanced SQL features such as window functions, SUM(), and PARTITION BY for optimized analysis.
- **Tableau Visualizations**: Designed interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize global Covid-19 trends, including real-time case counts, vaccination progress, and regional differences in infection and death rates.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Developed a Power BI dashboard that integrated Covid-19 data, providing stakeholders with an interactive and detailed overview of infection rates, vaccination coverage, and death statistics, enabling data-driven decision-making.
